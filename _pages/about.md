Welcome to my personal blog. My name is DaniÃ«l and I am a Data Engineer professional in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

I work as a Data Engineer at Xebia. I've spent much of my career on building Data Platforms and Data Pipelines.

I am passionate about cloud engineering, data engineering, and software engineering. I love to tinker with new technologies and share my experiences with others.
